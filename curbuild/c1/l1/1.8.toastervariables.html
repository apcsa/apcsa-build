            What kinds of variables does the toaster object need? 
            Put another way, what kinds of information does the toaster,  
            from the standpoint of the above behaviors, need to track in order to work properly? 
            Some possibilities include:
        </p>
        <ul audio="3">
            <li>the darkness setting </li>
            <li>the time that remains while the bread is getting toasted</li>
        </ul>
        <p audio="4">
            But what about these variables?
        </p>
        <ul audio="5">
            <li>is bread in slot 1?</li>
            <li>is bread in slot 2?</li>
        </ul>
        <p audio="6">
            Newer toasters have sensors that check whether bread is
            present, and in which slot, and adjust the heat accordingly.
            Older toasters, though, don't really care whether there is bread 
            in one of the slots or not: activating the "toast the bread" 
            behavior simply turns on the heat for a certain amount of time. 
            If we want more sophisticated behavior from the toaster, it will
            need additional variables.
