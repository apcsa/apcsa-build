                An alarm clock has to be pretty good at <em>remembering</em>
                when it will do the "sound the alarm" behavior, 
                or it would be a very poor alarm clock.  
                Each object, either in the real world or in programming, needs to have a <em>memory</em>.

                The way to have memory in object-oriented programming is to create a set of information items 
                associated with a programming object.  
                We call each of these a <span class="vocab">variable</span>.
