        <p audio="1">An object may have other objects in its internal state.</p>
        <p audio="2">For example, a person's state might include her age (a number), 
        her Social Security number (another number or maybe a string), her name
        (maybe a string, but we'll explore this further in a bit), and so forth.  
        The person's state might also have information about 
        who her father is: a person object with its own name, age, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p audio="2a">
         Also consider a deck of cards, which will contain a sequence 
            of card objects in its internal state.</p>
        <br/>
        <p audio="3" class="redFlag">We'll explore ways to build objects from an 
        assembly of different objects (like age, SS#, name, etc.)
		 or from an assembly of similar objects (like names, other people, and cards).</p>
