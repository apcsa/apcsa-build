<p>
The tick behavior included a comparison to check if the clock time was the same as the alarm time.  This use of tests to determine how the behavior should proceed is quite common.
</p>
<p>
Another useful distinction among behaviors is whether they are activated externally (e.g. by the person using the clock) or internally (by some other clock behavior).
Externally initiated behaviors we've seen so far are
</p>
<ul>
<li>set the alarm time to _____</li>
<li>set the clock time to _____</li>
<li>disable the alarm sound</li>
<li>enable the alarm sound</li>
<li>shut the alarm off</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following behaviors are activated from inside another clock behavior.
</p>
<ul>
<li>tick</li>
<li>sound the alarm</li>
<li>compare the clock time and the alarm time</li>
</ul>
