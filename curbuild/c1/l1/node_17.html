<p>
When we look for the behaviors and state of an object, we must also determine what level of detail we want to model.
Are we interested in ring tones?
If so, we need something in the state to represent the ring tone.
Are we interested in speed dialing?
Some sort of state that associates buttons with phone numbers has to be provided.
Some behaviors or state of the phone won't appear in our model because we're not interested in modeling them.
Others are just at too low a level of detail, e.g. the electronics of a toaster or the particular kind of display in a clock.
