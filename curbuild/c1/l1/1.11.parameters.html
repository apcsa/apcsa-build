            Basically, we have a pattern that combines behavior with information:</p>
        <div audio="2" class="quoteOrange">
            "To make a ________ milk shake, combine ________ with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender."
        </div>
        <p audio="3">The information is what flavor milkshake is desired and what fruit
        or flavor of ice cream to use.</p>
        <p audio="4">In the alarm clock example, we represented the similarity information as state variables associated with the object. 
            An alternative is to associate the information only with a particular behavior&mdash;in this case, milk shake making. 
            A piece of information that's used in this relatively minor way is called a <em><span class="vocab">parameter</span></em>.</p>
