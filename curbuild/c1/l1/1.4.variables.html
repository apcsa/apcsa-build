                Behaviors are actions that the object can perform; state consists of information (variables)

            A programming object can keep track of many different pieces of information 
            by containing many different variables.  
            We refer to each variable by its <span class="vocab">name</span>. 
            Each variable will also have a <span class="vocab">value</span>, the thing that is being remembered. 
            (The value may vary&mdash;it might be one thing at one point in a program,
            and another thing at another point&mdash;which is why we use the term "variable".) 
            <br /><br />
            This information&mdash;the values of all the variables taken together&mdash;is called the object's <span class="vocab">state</span>.
        </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p audio="variables4" class="quoteorange">
            It is useful to imagine that the variable is a box.  The &ldquo;thing&rdquo; inside the box is its value at any particular point in time.
