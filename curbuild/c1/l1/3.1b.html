        <p audio="1">Numbers are used when we would like to <em>compare</em> one object's information with another
            to find out which is larger or smaller. Strings are used in places requiring text information,
            say, a person's name, a book title, or the value on a license plate.  Note that a license plate
            might have both numbers and text in it.  A string can handle combinations of these.
            </p>
        <p audio="2" class="quoteOrange">You're probably not surprised to find that a 
        programming object deals with numbers and text.
            You may be surprised to find yes-or-no information handled specially.
            That's because this kind of information is so common.</p>
