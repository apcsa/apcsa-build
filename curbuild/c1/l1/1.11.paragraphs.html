        were either:</p>
        <ol audio="2">
                    <li>Combine strawberry ice cream with milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine blueberry ice cream with milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine raspberry ice cream with milk in a blender.</li>
        </ol>
        <p audio="3">
        or
        </p><ol audio="4">
                   <li>Combine strawberries with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine blueberries with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine raspberries with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender.</li>

        "Do the same thing as you just did, except use raspberries 
        (or raspberry ice cream)
            instead of strawberries (or strawberry ice cream)."</p>
