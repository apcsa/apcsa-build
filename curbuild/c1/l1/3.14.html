<p audio="1">We'll now work with a simulation of a program to draw a figure on the screen that represents a 4x4 game
board on which is placed one game piece. The positions on the board are pairs of numbers: a row number (between 1 and 4) and
a column number (also between 1 and 4). A piece at position (1, 1) is at the 
upper left corner of the board; the position (3,4) is where the robot
<tt>Float</tt> will land
in the picture above.</p>
<p audio="2">Our game board class is organized as follows. The internal state is the position of the piece (a row number
and a column number) and the color to make the board. There are several methods:</p>
<ul>
		<li audio="3">A constructor.</li>
		<li audio="4"><code> drawBoard ( ) </code> draws the whole board.</li>
		<li audio="5"><code> drawHorizontalLine (int) </code> draws a horizontal line at a given position on the screen.</li>
		<li audio="6"><code> drawVerticalLine (int) </code> draws a vertical line at a given position on the screen.</li>
		<li audio="7"><code> drawPiece ( ) </code> draws the piece.</li>
		<li audio="8"><code> move (int, int) </code> moves the piece to the given position and changes its state accordingly.</li>
		<li audio="9"><code> erase ( ) </code> erases the board.</li>
</ul>
