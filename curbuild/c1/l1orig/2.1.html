        <p audio="1">In programming, we distinguish between the <em>concept</em> of an object&mdash; 
            represented by a description of the object's behaviors and state&mdash;and the object itself.  
            We hinted at that distinction previously. For example, the description of an alarm clock's behaviors and state 
            isn't the same as an actual clock. There can be many actual clocks, but only one summarizing description.  
            In programming, we call this concept or summarizing description a <span class="vocab">class</span>. 
            Particular things that fit the description are <span class="vocab">instances</span> of the class.
            Instances all have the same behaviors, but usually have different state information.
The state variables for a class or object are referred to as
<span class="vocab">instance variables</span>.</p>
        <p audio="2">We've discussed classes already, describing clocks, toasters, cell phones, and MP3 players.
            Here are some more real-world examples.</p>
        <table id="tableBlue">
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <b audio="3">real-world "class"</b>
                </th>
                <th>
                    <b audio="4">real-world instances</b>
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p audio="5">A shoe class. Its state information includes size, color, and style. 
                        A simple behavior would be to communicate its size to someone. </p>

                        Its behaviors include making a reservation, cancelling a reservation,
                        and determining what restaurants have tables available at a given time and date.
                        Its state information includes the collection of upcoming reservations people have made
                        and the set of restaurants at which one can make a reservation.</p>
