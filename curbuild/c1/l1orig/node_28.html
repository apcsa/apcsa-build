        <p audio="8">Finally, we encountered objects in Java programs. 
            Objects have <strong>variables</strong>, and the state of these variables will be represented using numeric values,
            text values, Boolean (yes-or-no) values, and combinations of these three.
            Objects also have <strong>methods</strong> that represent their behaviors.</p>
        <p audio="9">In addition, we took an extended look into a program that 
        draws a game board, specifically at how its methods are
            called in a sequence.</p>
