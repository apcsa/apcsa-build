<title>Representing behaviors as Java methods</title>
</head>
<body>

<p audio="1">Behaviors in Java are called <strong>methods</strong>. Each method has a <strong>heading</strong> that gives
its name, the type of information it provides, and the names and types of its parameters. It also has a <strong>body</strong>,
a sequence of steps&mdash;statements&mdash;that it performs to produce its result.</p>

<p audio="2">Steps in a method body are similar to steps in a recipe. For example, the method representing the behavior
of a calculator's accumulator behavior might involve the following steps:</p>
<ol>
		<li audio="3">Convert a sequence of digit keystrokes into a number</li>
		<li audio="4">Decide whether to add or subtract that number to the value already accumulated, or replace that value</li>
		<li audio="5">Display the result</li>
</ol>
<p audio="6">This is not so different from:</p>
<ol>
		<li audio="7">Put a cup of blueberries into a blender.</li>
		<li audio="8">Put a cup of vanilla ice cream into the blender.</li>
		<li audio="9">Put a cup of milk into the blender.</li>
		<li audio="10">Blend.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p audio="11" class="quoteBrown">What's the outcome? This method that produces a blueberry milk shake.</p>
<p>
Translating a model to a program will involve extra behaviors that represent ways to access state information.
For example, a shoe in the real world doesn't tell us its size color, or style; we just see that when we look at the shoe.
In a computer model, however, we need behaviors to access this information because we can't "see" it otherwise.
