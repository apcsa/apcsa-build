       <p audio="5">Next, we encountered the idea of a <strong>class</strong>&mdash;a sort of blueprint or pattern from which objects with a given behavior and state may be produced.  
            &nbsp;Each object produced from a class is an <strong>instance</strong> of the class.</p>
        <p audio="6">We examined several examples of classes and instances: shoes, online restaurant reservation services, songs, restaurants, books, and playing cards.</p>

            When run, the program will produce objects that will interact, produce output, and so on.</p>
